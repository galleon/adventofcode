## Advent of Code

Year 2022 using `Python` as the main language, `Rust` and `Cobol`. `Rust` will have its own branch!

```
pip install -e .
```

- `scripts/day14_seanburton.py`  is given for reference but is not working :-)
- `scripts/day15_portion.py` is an attempt to solve the problem using `portion`. Second part took 1'15" to run. It's `z3` counter part is blazing fast.
- `scripts/day15_veryslow.py` don't use that one.
- `scripts/day16_z3.py` is an unfinished attempt to solve the problem using `z3`
- `scripts/day19_simple.py` is also using `z3`
- `scripts/day25.cob` is an attempt to solve the problem in `COBOL`. Use `cobc -x -free scripts/day25.cob` to compile it.
